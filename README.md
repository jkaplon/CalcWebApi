CalcWebApi
==========

Web-based calculator exercise using Microsoft's WebApi.
I wanted some C# on my github page, and thought this little project would do nicely.
VisualStudio definitely likes to create lots of files, so hopefully the default .gitignore settings for VisualStudio on github will keep out most of the clutter.
